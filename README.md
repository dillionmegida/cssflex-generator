## CSS-Flex Generator

I was inspired by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)'s project - [CSS-Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.com/) - and decided to build something similar for flex containers.

### Introduction

Ever since the introduction of Flex and Grid Containers, layouts have become easy to create as they are also flexible.

This project provides an easy means for creating CSS Flex containers for flexible layouts.
It aids in efficient understanding of the flex property and it also generate codes.

This application was built with one of ReactJS' toolchains - [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
